Exercise 1:
	extracted a class "Clipper" and moved clipping functionalities from class Matcher
	extracted a method "compareEachEntry" from "match" in Matcher class

Exercise 2:
	in class ConfigurationTest changed assertTrue(false) to fail()
	changed accsess from pubic to private. Added getters
	extracted a method "loadInterval" from "load"
	extracted a method "loadDuration" from "load"
	extracted a method "loadDeparture" from "load"

Execise 3:
	modified "testComplexExpression" for more readability
	used Extract interface(kinda). Created IEvaluable interace and implementations for constant and operator expressions.
	Bad-smells identified and not fixed:
		creating an Enum for operators.
		changing runtime exception to compile-time(as far as I know, it's conidered to be a bad idea to use runtime exception for situations which may occur without "ruining" something. In our case, "op" field may be any character)
